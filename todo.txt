Aligned the "LP" logo as I decided to delete the lines.
I made it more responsive, fixed how the image and circle behind behave and are spaced

Todo:
    Email, "Porfolio 2024" are two elements that needs to be placed 
    On the navbar, the circle, bottom right...

    I need to think also about where to place the hobbies carousel cuz original placement isn't good
    --> what importance should I give it?
    --> should it be more important than my name?
    --> Hierarchy

    Should go back to Figma to rething the design

    Same list that 09/08
