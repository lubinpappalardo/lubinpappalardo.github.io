[] - navbar links need interaction
[] - mobile menu
[...] - overall responsive design
[] - light/dark mode icon hover effect ?
X - Done    ? - Thinking about it   ... - In progress   [] - Not started    / - Canceled

Aligned the "LP" logo as I decided to delete the lines.
I made it more responsive, fixed how the image and circle behind behave and are spaced

Todo:
    Email, "Porfolio 2024" are two elements that needs to be placed 
    On the navbar, the circle, bottom right...

    I need to think also about where to place the hobbies carousel cuz original placement isn't good
    --> what importance should I give it?
    --> should it be more important than my name?
    --> Hierarchy

    Should go back to Figma to rething the design

    Same list that 09/08

-----------------
11/08
Downloaded Jquery to host local
Added the animated hamburger menu icon to cross icon animation (I had to remake it)
Set up the mobile menu open/close behavior
"Porfolio 2024" and email placement sorted out
Made some design variations on Figma on what to do with the hobby carousel

-----------------

Still stuck with the layout
Spent a lot of time on figma

13/08
Same.

lol

Ok I have something (only for header still).
I'll have to redo everything but that's fine.
Starting dev tomorrow

My only worry is that I do need a better picture, but changing it might lead to redesign... Definetly not as radical as this but a change in layout 

-----------------

I've been coding for 4 hours straight so I think I'm done for today
Overall the header is done, I added interactions, etc

TODO:
- Mobile Menu
- Maybe improver responsive design

Also I think I'll have to do the scroll animations via JS and not via CSS cause not being able to use overflow: hidden is causing too many problems
